`emissary` is a lightweight and embeddable [I2P](https://geti2p.net/) router

### Features

  * NTCP2
  * SSU2 (experimental)
* Client protocols:
  * I2CP
  * SAMv3
* Proxies:
  * HTTP

### Directory layout

* `emissary-core/` - I2P protocol implementation as an asynchronous library
* `emissary-util/` - `emissary-core`-related utilities, such as runtime implementations and reseeder
* `emissary-cli/` - `tokio`-based I2P router implementation

### Usage

1) Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/emissary-cli): `cargo install emissary-cli`
2) Build from sources: `cargo build --release`

Router installs its files under `$HOME/.emissary`, automatically reseeds over HTTPS on first boot and creates a default configuration. For instructions on how to browse and host eepsites, use torrents, or chat on Irc2P, visit [documentation](https://altonen.github.io/emissary/).
